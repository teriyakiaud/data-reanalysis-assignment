#Intro and Description

In their study, Nunes et al. (2016) examined 2 different types of non-calcifying algae to see the effect of ocean acidification on different aspects on their growth and productivity. They assessed variables such as net primary production, respiration, levels of the compound DMSP, and physical growth. 

```{r}
f <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teriyakiaud/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/Nunes_2015(1).csv"
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE)
head(d)
```

```{r}
#this dataframe contains only values from the P. palmata species. I separated them because the paper states that each experiment and analysis for the 2 species was done separately.  

d1 <- data.frame(d[1:227,])
d1
```
```{r}
#this dataframe contains only values from S. latissima for the reason stated above.

d2 <- data.frame(d[228:386,])
d2
```

#Analysis 1: Determining the most useful model for NPP
## Assessment of Normality

Net Primary Productivity in this paper was determined as the difference in dissolved oxygen concentrations between measurements taken at the start of the experiment and at the end of the light incubation period.
First, as in the paper, I used a qqnorm plot along with a histogram to show that the data for NPP is clearly not linear or normal.  

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(d1$NPP.O2, xlab = "Difference in O2 (NPP)", main = "NPP of P. palmata")
qqnorm(d1$NPP.O2, main = "NPP of P. palmata")
hist(d2$NPP.O2, xlab = "Difference in O2 (NPP)", main = "NPP of S. latissima")
qqnorm(d2$NPP.O2, main = "NPP of S. latissima")

#we can see that the data is clearly not normal. 
```

##Comparing possible models using AIC and log likelihoods

In the paper, it seemed to me that the indicator of 'OA' was the pH (Potentiometric) measurement and not the pH calculated by seacarb though this was not made clear. Therefore, I used the potentiometric values for my analysis. The 'Treat' column may also have been used for OA as this shows the concentration of CO2 in each sample, but since these values matched up with the pH values, I used the pH values instead. 

###Models for P. palmata NPP

In this part of the paper, Nunes et al. considered several different models to see what affected net primary production. They did this for both species, but for the purpose of this reanalysis, I am only looking at P. palmata. 

```{r}
#all of the possible models that were considered in the study 
#Duration is Time and Potentiometric.pH is OA as they appear in the paper.

m1 <- lm(data = d1, NPP.O2 ~ Duration * Potentiometric.pH)
m2 <- lm(data = d1, NPP.O2 ~ Duration + Potentiometric.pH)
m3 <- lm(data = d1, NPP.O2 ~ Duration)
m4 <- lm(data = d1, NPP.O2 ~ Potentiometric.pH)
m5 <- lm(data = d1, NPP.O2 ~ 1)

#m5 is the simplest model and m1 the most complex
```

This paper used forward selection and added predictor variables to make increasing more complex models to see which model fit best. 

```{r}
m5 <- lm(data = d1, NPP.O2 ~ 1)
summary(m5)
```
```{r}
add1(m5, scope = .~. + Duration + Potentiometric.pH, test = "F")
```
```{r}
m4<- update(m5, formula = .~. + Potentiometric.pH)
summary(m4)
```
```{r}
m3<- update(m5, formula = .~. + Duration)
summary(m3)
```

```{r}
add1(m3, scope = .~. + Duration + Potentiometric.pH, test = "F")

#this is the best model
```
```{r}
m2 <- update(m4, formula = .~. + Duration)
summary(m2)
```
```{r}
m1 <- update(m4, formula = .~. * Duration)
summary(m1)
```
In addition to doing the additions by hand above, I also used the stepAIC function below to more clearly show which is the best model. 

```{r}
library(MASS)
stepAIC(m1, direction = "both")
```
```{r}
logLik(m2)
logLik(m1)
#there is no significant increase in log-likelihood from model m2 (our best model) to m1 (the most complex)
```
The results of this section show that the model I've named as m2 or NPP.O2 ~ Duration + Potentiometric.pH is the best model to use, according to both AIC values and log-likelihood values. THis matches up with the model that the authors of the paper used. Though we had different AIC values, they followed the same trend. 

Here we can compare with the results of the paper in terms of NPP and see that Nunes et al. used the same model for NPP.

This ultimately shows that both time and ocean acidification are important factors affecting NPP in P. palmata. 

#Analysis 2: Finding the best model for respiration
Respiration values in this paper were taken as the difference in dissolved oxygen between measurements taken at the start of the experiment and the end of the dark incubation period. 

The respiration analysis was done in a similar manner to the NPP analysis and again the first step was to use the qq plot to determine if the data was normal. 

For the purpose of this reanalysis, I will be looking at only S. latissima during this part. 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(d2$Resp.O2, xlab = "Change in Dissolved O2 (Respiration)", main = "Respiration of P. palmata")
qqnorm(d2$Resp.O2, main = "DMSP of P. palmata")
hist(d2$Resp.O2, xlab = "Change in Dissolved O2 (Respiration)", main = "Respiration of S. latissima")
qqnorm(d2$Resp.O2, main = "Respiration of S. latissima")
```

Just like with NPP, the qq plots and histograms show us that the data for respiration in S.latissima is NOT linear. 

##Models for Respiration in S. latissima

```{r}
#again, here are the potential models with s5 representing the least complex and s1 the most complex.

s1 <- lm(data = d2, Resp.O2 ~ Duration * Potentiometric.pH)
s2 <- lm(data = d2, Resp.O2 ~ Duration + Potentiometric.pH)
s3 <- lm(data = d2, Resp.O2 ~ Duration)
s4 <- lm(data = d2, Resp.O2 ~ Potentiometric.pH)
s5 <- lm(data = d2, Resp.O2 ~ 1)
```
```{r}
s5 <- lm(data = d2, Resp.O2 ~ 1)
summary(s5)
```
```{r}
add1(s5, scope = .~. + Duration + Potentiometric.pH, test = "F")
```
```{r}
s4<- update(s5, formula = .~. + Potentiometric.pH)
summary(s4)
```
```{r}
s3<- update(s5, formula = .~. + Duration)
summary(s3)
```
```{r}
add1(s3, scope = .~. + Duration + Potentiometric.pH, test = "F")

```
```{r}
s2 <- update(s4, formula = .~. + Duration)
summary(s2)
```
Using AIC values, We see here that the best model for respiration in S. latissima is one that takes into account both ocean acidification and time, just like we see in P. palmata for NPP. Again, we can compare this to the model that Nunes et. al used in their paper.

#Analysis 3: Effects of Acidification and Time on DMSP concentration

In this analysis, I will be showing that DMSP levels varied depending on sample location in S. latissima. DMSP is dimethylsulphoniopropionate, a compound that plays a role as an antioxidant and precursor to predator defense in algae. Nunes et al. state that little is currently known about the effect of acidification and increased CO2 levels on algal production of DMSP. They show in their study there does not seem to be any effect of acidification or time on DMSP production.

##Determining the Correct Data to Analyze

First, I use a boxplot to show that there is a significant difference in the amount of DMSP produced by S. latissima depending on where along the frond Nunes et al. collected samples from. 
```{r}
boxplot(DMSP ~ Position, data = d2, xlab = "Position along the Frond", ylab = "DMSP Concentration (Î¼g g-1)", main = "Difference in DMSP Concentration based on Location")

# the boxplot clearly shows that concentrations of DMSP at the base of the frond are much greater than at the tip of the frond. 
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
f1 <- filter(d2, Position == "base of the frond")
f1

#i used the filter function here to separate the specific position along the frond that Nunes et al. collected DMSP data from. f1 shows data from the base of the frond.
```

```{r}
f2 <- filter(d2, Position == "tip of the frond")
f2

#f2 shows DMSP data from the tip of the frond. 
```

```{r}
mean1 <- mean(f1$DMSP, na.rm = TRUE) #mean DMSP for base of the frond
mean1
mean2 <- mean(f2$DMSP, na.rm = TRUE) #mean DMSP for the tip of the frond
mean2

#this is a simple quantification of what we see in the first boxplot. We can see that the mean DMSP concentration for the base of the frond is much greater than for the tip of the frond. 
```
We can compare my results from the boxplot to the results that Nunes et al. found regarding the differing concentration levels. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teriyakiaud/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/fig%203.PNG)

This initial exploratory analysis showed them that it would be more useful to base the rest of their analyses regarding the effect of acidification and time on DMSP production on samples taken from the base of the frond rather than samples from the tip of the frond. 

##Determining the Best Model and Analyzing Changes in DMSP Concentration
Next, they looked at how acidification and time affected DMSP levels. They did this for both P. palmata and S. latissima but again, for the purpose of this reanalysis, I will only be looking at S. latissima. 
```{r}
boxplot(DMSP ~ Duration, data = f1, xlab = "Time of Collection", ylab = "DMSP Levels", main = "DMSP levels at Base of Frond")

#this boxplot helps to visually represent that no significant change occured between the DMSP levels collected at time 0 to time 4 (4 weeks after). We are now only looking at samples from the base of the frond.
```
```{r}
time1 <- filter(f1, Duration == "0")
time1
```
```{r}
time2 <- filter(f1, Duration == "4")
time2
```
```{r}
dmmean1 <- mean(time1$DMSP, na.rm = TRUE)
dmmean1
dmmean2 <- mean(time2$DMSP, na.rm = TRUE)
dmmean2

#this is another quantification of what we see in the second boxplot above. We can see that there is no clear difference in the means of DMSP over time when comparing between week 0 and week 4. I will go further into this below. 
```

Here I go over the models again for the variables affecting DMSP concentrations. These models are the same as for NPP and respiration, but we will see that the conclusions for the best model differ. 
```{r}
dm1 <- lm(data = f1, DMSP ~ Duration * Potentiometric.pH)
dm2 <- lm(data = f1, DMSP ~ Duration + Potentiometric.pH)
dm3 <- lm(data = f1, DMSP ~ Duration)
dm4 <- lm(data = f1, DMSP ~ Potentiometric.pH)
dm5 <- lm(data = f1, DMSP ~ 1)
```
```{r}
stepAIC(dm1, direction = "both")

#since I did very similar analyses above, I did not do the step-by-step forward selection for models as I did above. Instead I just used the stepAIC function.
```
The results of the stepAIC show us that the best model to use is actually the simplest one (or model dm5) and that acidification and time do not seem to have an effect on DMSP concentrations. Again, we can compare this to the results from Nunes et al.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teriyakiaud/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/table%205.PNG)

Finally, I use a simple t-test to show that there is no significance between the concentrations of DMSP from week 0 to week 4. 

```{r}
t <- t.test(x = time1$DMSP, y = time2$DMSP, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")
t

#we can use the t-test here to show that there really is not a significant change. The output p-value is 0.5915 which is insignificant. 
```
Altogether, this analysis leads to the conclusion that in S. latissima, there is no effect of CO2/acidification on DMSP production and concentration.
